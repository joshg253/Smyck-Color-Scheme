# Smyck Color Scheme

This is a color scheme suitable for Terminal.app, iTerm2, Vim, gVim, MacVim, Textmate, Sublime Text 2, and Xfce Terminal.

The colors are carefully chosen and the contrasts are tuned so that it should not hurt the eyes even after a whole day of working.

## Xfce Terminal

Copy smyck.theme to ~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/ and it should show up under the Color Presets.

## Eclipse
There is also an Eclipse adoption of this theme available at
[https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme](https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme).

# Disclaimer

Currently its still a moving target but if you want to help, please try
it out and report screenshots of weird looking things.

Once the final color map is done this repository will include a proper
documentation.
